# Module 1 - Lab 2 - Exercise 6 - View audit history for Azure AD roles in PIM


You can use the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) audit history to see all the role assignments and activations within the past 30 days for all privileged roles. If you want to see the full audit history of activity in your directory, including administrator, end user, and synchronization activity, you can use the [Azure Active Directory security and activity reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-reports).
